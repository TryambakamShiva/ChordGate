# ChordGate
This repository is about a humble Python-Flask based web-application to extract guitar chords and generate chord-diagrams from audio (music) files (MP3, WAV, AIFF and FLAC). The extracted chords and chord-diagram can then be saved as .pdf file. It is based on combined works of other GitHub repositories and all due credits given inside. Regards.
